node_modules = Node modules allow users to reuse existing code instead of reinventing the wheel. This can save time and effort by leveraging the work of others in the NodeJS community. Modularity: Node modules promote a modular approach to software development.

package.json = to identify your project and understand how to handle the project's dependencies.

.editorconfig = maintain consistent coding styles and conventions in a codebase, regardless of the editor or IDE you use.

.gitignore = location of file not included on the commit

angular.json = project configuration. The angular.json file at the root level of an Angular workspace provides workspace-wide and project-specific configuration defaults

package-lock.json = to ensure that the same dependencies are installed consistently across different environments, such as development and production environments

tsconfig.json =  allows you to configure how the TypeScript compiler processes your TypeScript code

src folder = most important folder of all.

main.ts = starting of the project.
